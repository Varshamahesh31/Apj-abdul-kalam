        <p><b><center>Legacy and impacts of Martin Luther King Jr.</center></b></p>
        <p>Collectively, he and other civil rights activists could affect policies and influence change nationwide. Dr. King's leadership contributed to the overall success of the civil rights movement in the mid-1900s and continues to impact civil rights movements in the present</p>
        <p>King's death energized the Black Power Movement. Black Americans felt even more distrustful of white institutions and America's political system. Membership in the Black Panther Party and other Black Power groups surged. Local organizations grew into national networks.</p>
        <p>The culmination of this event was the influential and most memorable speech of Dr. King's career. Popularly known as the "I have a Dream" speech, the words of Martin Luther King, Jr. influenced the Federal government to take more direct actions to more fully realize racial equality</p>
        <p>Dr. King's leadership contributed to the overall success of the civil rights movement in the mid-1900s and continues to impact civil rights movements in the present. While King and other leaders generated momentous strides for equality, the push for civil rights remains a preeminent challenge today.</p>
