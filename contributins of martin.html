When MLK Jr. was a little boy, it saddened him that he could not befriend people who were not black.  He knew in his heart that just because people may look different on the outside, the contents of their hearts and their character is what makes a person valuable.  Martin Luther King Jr. saw a social problem, developed a dream, and eventually by taking action he changed the United States as well as the world.  He is still today among the most well known social activists in the world.
